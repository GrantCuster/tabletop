Architecture

- [x] make a new repo for all themes - localhost:4002?
- [x] each theme lives on a route
- [x] theme atom is then url and optional name
- [x] set up iframe, render it first, worry about events later

Add block / Calendar view

- [x] Change add form so it contains day timeline - that's the only place that lives
- [x] More readable options for adding a block
- [x] Visualize event you're adding in the timeline

SCRATCH
that should also be edit block interface? - so selected - maybe that means it's a more general view with the calendar emoji
